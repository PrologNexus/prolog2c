* Registers

  | E     | location of environment in env-stack |
  | S     | control stack ptr                    |
  | T     | trail ptr                            |
  | C     | choice-point stack ptr               |
  | C0    | C at predicate-entry                 |
  | R     | return address                       |
  | F     | frame pointer in value stack         |
  | R0    | temporary return address             |
  | A0... | argument registers                   |

* Data areas
** Trail
   - holds variables that where bound recently.
** Data stack
   - for intermediate values and the local environment.
** Choice-point stack
   - each entry holds:
     - previous T, R, S, E, C0
     - label (where execution continues)
** Heap

* Optimization opportunities
** Anonymous variables could get special handling when in argument position
   - unification is a noop, unless nested in another term.
** Mode-declarations
** Clause indexing
*** This could even be extended to invoke particular entry-points depending on call-arguments
** Last clause of predicate with a single call can be treated as determinate (and enable TCO)

* Things to test
  - trail-unwinding.
  - failure-driven loop, repeat/0
  - unification (both directions)
  - TCO.
  - test debug-output of arguments with TRACE.
  - GC.
  - practically everything.

* Missing
** Compilation of ordering operators
   - @<, @>, @>=, @=<
** Numerical functions
   - sqrt, etc.
** record-db
** I/O
** runtime-information about defined clauses
   - for clause/2 we would actually need the full source.
** All ISO-stuff that makes sense

* Diagnostics
** Detect singleton variables
** Detect redefinitions of primitives
** Detect non-contiguous predicates

* Issues
** Compiler
*** TODO unbound var in arithmetic expr doesn't show variable name
   - extend var-rep to hold name, in addition to index.
*** TODO implement minimum set of directives
   - determinate :: register as determinate, use this to find more TCO
                    opportunities.
*** TODO check fixnum range when emitting literals 
*** TODO At some stage auto-include file:prelude.pl
    - unless "-n" option is given.
*** TODO allow file-references to be "library(FILE)"
    - resolve via library-path, settable by "-L".
*** TODO handle type-predicates inline
    - primitives:
      integer(R), var(R), non_var(R), atom(R), atomic(R), number(R)
*** TODO add instructions to push immediate literals
   - fixnums, [].
** Runtime
*** TODO is cycle-checking in =deref= really necessary?
*** TODO use hash-tables for symbol-table
*** TRACE_FAIL should only print something on clause-exit
    - "fail" in disjunctions may not actually leave the clause.
*** TODO Remove GC'd variables from trail
    - and adjust CP-stack entries accordingly.
** Library
*** TODO Extend file:rdtok.pl
    - add support for floating-point numbers.
    - allow 2-digit radix in integers.
    - allow escape characters in strings and quoted atoms.
