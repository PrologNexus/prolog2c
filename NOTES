* Optimization opportunities
** Anonymous variables could get special handling when in argument position
   - unification is a noop, unless nested in another term.
** Mode-declarations
** Determinacy declarations
   - i.e. ":- determinate(PI)."
** Clause indexing
*** This could even be extended to invoke particular entry-points depending on call-arguments
** Last clause of predicate with a single call can be treated as determinate (and enable TCO)
   - if we know about determinacy of library predicates, this could be
     generalized to multiple calls.
** Deterministic goal in condition of if-then-else can drop CP dance
   - same for '\\+'/2
* Things to test
** TODO GC symbol-reclamation.
** TODO all numerical functions + operators.
** TODO file:queens.pl, file:code/crypta.pl
* Missing
** Compiler
*** Write driver script
    - handles compilation to C.
    - could run separate program to preprocess source.
    - could even filter out latent term_expansions expressions and build
      preprocessor on the fly.
*** Use preprocessor for implementing term_expansion
*** Allow selective tracing
    - declaration "trace(PI)", where PI may be atom, NAME/ARITY, or
      list of those.
** Library/Runtime
*** Allocate all data areas dynamically
    - add runtime-options to set sizes (trail, args, env).
*** Internal infrastructure for record-db 
    - simple key-value store (hashtable), with operations to add,
      remove, lookup.
    - add (atomic?) type DBREFERENCE, decide on sort-ordering.
*** We could install a SIGSEGV handler and dump all global state
    - stack-ptrs, VM-registers, etc.
*** Runtime-information about defined clauses
    - as minimum: mapping of name/arity -> entry-point.
    - for complete support of clause/2 we would actually need the full
      source.
*** Provide some surt of embedding
    - could have distinct entry point that returns an invocation
      function ptr, calling a suspension primitive from prolog then
      returns some value to the caller, reinvocation continues, with a
      result.
    - "foreign_call(suspend(OUT, IN))"
*** Basic Edinburgh I/O
    - "see", "seen", "seeing", "tell", "told", "telling"
    - stream-alias "user" (default I/O ports)
    - "get", "get0", "put", "peek"
*** Non-standard primitives we need for bootstrapping

* Diagnostics
** Detect singleton variables
** Detect redefinitions of primitives
** Detect non-contiguous predicates
* Issues
** Compiler
*** TODO Detect invalid commmand-line options
*** TODO Improve and extend directives
    - include :: allow omitting file-extension.
    - ensure_loaded :: like "include", but include only once.
    - determinate :: register as determinate, use this to find more TCO
                    opportunities.
*** TODO Unbound var in arithmetic expr doesn't show variable name
   - extend var-rep to hold name, in addition to index.
*** TODO check fixnum range when emitting literals 
*** TODO At some stage auto-include file:prelude.pl
    - unless "-n" option is given.
*** TODO allow file-references to be "library(FILE)"
    - resolve via library-path, settable by "-L".
** Runtime
*** TODO The trail is never reduced
**** TODO Remove GC'd variables from trail
     - and adjust CP-stack entries accordingly.
     - tricky.
*** TODO Should "make_term" deref it's args, especially the functor?
*** TODO Is cycle-checking in =deref= really necessary?
