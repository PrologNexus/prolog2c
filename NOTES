* Optimization opportunities
** Anonymous variables could get special handling when in argument position
   - unification is a noop, unless nested in another term.
** Mode-declarations
** Determinacy declarations
   - i.e. ":- determinate(PI)."
** Clause indexing
*** This could even be extended to invoke particular entry-points depending on call-arguments
** Arithmetic
   - deref all vars just once at start.
   - track types, use unboxed math.
** Last clause of predicate with a single call can be treated as determinate (and enable TCO)
   - if we know about determinacy of library predicates, this could be
     generalized to multiple calls.
** Deterministic goal in condition of if-then-else can drop CP dance
   - same for '\\+'/2
* Things to test
** TODO GC symbol-reclamation.
** TODO file:io.pl
** TODO file:rdb.pl
** TODO file:code/crypta.pl
** TODO test file:rdtok.pl, file:read.pl (self-compiled)
*** TODO file:op.pl
** TODO tests for stuff in file:code/
   - ordsets, queues, writef, write
** TODO Test on Mac, Windows (32 bit) and R/Pi
* Missing features
** Compiler
*** TODO Add macros for everything in file:prelude.pl
    - include library files in boilerplate, as necessary.
    - remove that file afterwards.
*** TODO current_op/3 and op-database
    - need some internal DB
*** Add support for DCGs
    - probably using file:code/dcg.pl
*** TODO add auto-includes to file:macros.pl
    - file:misc.pl, file:op.pl, file:io.pl, file:rdb.pl
*** Allow selective tracing
    - declaration "trace(PI)", where PI may be atom, NAME/ARITY, or
      list of those.
** Library/Runtime
*** Make it possible to embed compiled code
    - "suspend(IN, OUT)" saves state and suspends execution.
    - define alternative entry-point via macro and return procedure
      ptr to invoke prolog (similar to BONES).
*** Runtime-information about defined clauses
    - as minimum: mapping of name/arity -> entry-point.
    - for complete support of clause/2 we would actually need the full
      source.
    - at least compiler could offer "call_predicate".
*** Basic Edinburgh I/O
    - "see", "seen", "seeing", "tell", "told", "telling", "get"
    - stream-alias "user" (default I/O ports)
    - add all as macros, auto-including library file:io.pl
*** TODO Primitives needed
    | atom_codes(ATOM, LIST)              |
    | number_codes(NUMBER, LIST)          | 
    | current_input(STREAM)               |
    | current_output(STREAM)              |
    | current_error_output(STREAM)        |
*** TODO Non-standard predicates we need for bootstrapping
    | getenv/1             | macro               |
    | atomic_list_concat/2 | add to file:misc.pl |
    | union/3              | file:sets.pl        |
* Diagnostics
** Detect singleton variables
** Detect redefinitions of primitives
** Detect non-contiguous predicates
* TODO Once we have a suitable test, compare performance with other implementations
  - maybe file:queens.pl
  - SWI, GNU-Prolog, BinProlog
* Issues
** Compiler
*** TODO Command-line option to set include-path
    - "-I PATH"
*** TODO Improve and extend directives
    - ensure_loaded :: like "include", but include only once (name
                       without extension.)
    - determinate :: register as determinate, use this to find more
                    TCO opportunities and reduce temporary CPs in
                    if-then-else, not, etc.
*** TODO Unbound var in arithmetic expr doesn't show variable name
   - extend var-rep to hold name, in addition to index.
*** TODO check fixnum range when emitting literals 
** Runtime
*** TODO Reconsider default data-area sizes
*** TODO trail-GC
    - and adjust CP-stack entries accordingly.
    - tricky.
*** TODO Should "make_term" deref it's args, especially the functor?
*** TODO Is cycle-checking in =deref= really necessary?
