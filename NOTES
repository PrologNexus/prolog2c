NOTES											              -*- Org -*-


* Wrapper generator
** Find a good example
** Add support for structs
   - struct X* <-> "X(...)"
** Add proper test
   - add to fullcheck.
* Optimization opportunities
** Use perfect hashing for atom-tables
   - http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/perfect.html
** Special-case primitives that are known to always succeed?
** Check: take advantage of timestamps when binding vars in unify() ?
   - implemented in branch /bind-younger/ and seems to work, but trail
** writeq/1 could use foreign_call(basic_writeq(X)) for atoms
   - but the name needs to be classified anyway, because of the possibly
     required space in front of it.
** Mode-declarations
   - can probably be used in many ways, but needs more thought.
** Arithmetic
   - deref all vars just once at start.
   - track types, use unboxed math.
** With some sort of type/groundness analysis many primitives can be rewritten to simpler forms
   - functor, arg, name, '=..', etc.
** Matching term in db could be done in C
*** Unify inside db_find/db_next (properly undwinding trail on failure)
    - handling heap-full case on thawing still makes this ugly.
** current_op/3 needs fast path when operator name is known
   - could use single-bucket db, with unififcation inside
     db_find/db_next (provided, we implement matching in file:pc.h)
** Deterministic goal in condition of if-then-else can drop some of the CP dance
   - same for '\\+'/2
   - fail could actually just perform a jump, perhaps redefine FAIL
     temporarily (or use intermediate macro).
** Analyze program before compiling to pseudo-instructions
   - perform determinacy-analysis for all code.
   - in other words: actually take advantage of having a static whole-program compiler.
* Missing features
** Some sort of formatted output would be nice
   - file:code/writef.pl uses those funny succ/2 and plus/3 predicates.
     - see file:code/arith.pl
** once/1
** DONE We need a foreign-pointer type
   - test.
** Builtin to read full atom
   - "read_atom(LENGTH)"
   - much cheaper than reading list.
** Allow user-defined macros
   - directive: ":- macro OLD -> NEW" or something like this.
** Extend numerical operators
   - constants "pi", perhaps "e"
   - "max", "min", "asin", "acos"
* Build options
** Allow static allocation of data-areas
   - statically allocated data for all areas.
   - fixed sizes for gap-buffer and string-buffer.
   - would need to put DBs, buckets and items into heap, using bytevectors.
** Allow keeping db-data in GC'd heap
   - freeze/thaw would be just a deep copy.
   - needs to check heap and possibly GC before asserting/recording.
** Make use of floating-point optional
   - see /intmath/ branch.
   - had funny behaviour with pi (use of flonum simple aborts.)

* Diagnostics
** Detect singleton variables
** Report unused predicates
* Once we have a suitable test, compare performance with other implementations
  - SWI, GNU-Prolog, BinProlog
* Issues
** 32-bit version can't tokenize fractional part of real if it doesn't fit into an integer
   - e.g.:
     main :- f(0.463647609000806).
** Everything is still rather slow and uses too much memory
   - see file:broken-tests/
** Once trail-stack reserve is reached, GC will happen all the time if the trail can't be reduced
** If heap is insufficient deref_term/3 will loop endlessly
** TODO Test once more on WIN64
** TODO Test once more on Mac
** TODO Does retract-loop work?
   - we know it works for the rdb, but should also test for cdb.
** TODO The output of TRACE_TAILCALL() is somewhat confusing
   - can we get rid of this?
** name/2 and functor/3 (and others?) may exceed heap-reserve for large inputs
** Reduce memory use in pc
   - seems to build up a lot of choice points.
** TODO 0085-boyer crashes in pi sometimes
** TODO [#B] Implementation of if-then-else is broken
   - if-then stack gets out of balance, found here:
     call_primitive('->', 2, TERM) :-
	!,
	arg(1, TERM, X), arg(2, TERM, Y),
	execute(X) -> execute(Y). % parsed as (!, ...) -> execute(Y)
   - adding parens around last goal repaired the problem, but still
     this shouldn't happen.
** Erasing a db-entry that is already marked is currently ignored
   - actual deletion will happen on next GC.
   - should we throw an error?
   - note that 0069-cdb deletes twice: first the retract of hello(X)
     and then the abolish of hello/1.
** Handle freezing of db-refs
   - disallow? delete from deleted-items list?
   - what can happen?
   - currently caught by assertion in freeze_term_recursive()
** Using multiple threads is currently not possible
   - all static vars would have to be declared TLS, but these may not
     be statically initialized with non-constants, and this applies to
     many data objects for literals.
   - but user-defined literals can't be shared, or not?
** Unbound var in arithmetic expr doesn't show variable name
   - extend var-rep to hold name, in addition to index.
** Reader-error should throw syntax_error(MSG)
** Throw ISO-compliant exceptions everywhere
    - at least as much as possible and sensible.
** Isn't most of the stuff in file:lib/ordset.pl, file:lib/sets.pl determinate?
* Interpreter
** Add support for file:dcg.pl 
   - term_expansion/2.
   - but I need a way to hook into consult/1 from file:pi.pl, because
     adding DCG-support to interp seems better.
** Additional predicates
   - listing/1
   - listing/0
     - needs some way to enumerate all predicates (current_predicate/1).
     - can use foreign_call(db_find_bucket(...))
