* Optimization opportunities
** Anonymous variables could get special handling when in argument position
   - unification is a noop, unless nested in another term.
** Implement memberchk/2 as primitive
** Mode-declarations
** Determinacy declarations
   - i.e. ":- determinate(PI)."
** Clause indexing
*** This could even be extended to invoke particular entry-points depending on call-arguments
** Arithmetic
   - deref all vars just once at start.
   - track types, use unboxed math.
** With some sort of type/groundness analysis many primitives can be rewritten to simpler forms
   - functor, arg, name, '=..', etc.
** Last clause of predicate with a single call can be treated as determinate (and enable TCO)
   - if we know about determinacy of library predicates, this could be
     generalized to multiple calls.
** Deterministic goal in condition of if-then-else can drop CP dance
   - same for '\\+'/2
* Things to test
** TODO test file:rdtok.pl, file:read.pl (self-compiled)
   - use of file:op.pl
** TODO GC symbol-reclamation
** TODO some non-trivial test for DCG rules
   - for example file:re.pl
** TODO test file:ordset.pl and add
** TODO file:code/writef.pl
** TODO tests for stuff in file:code/
   - ordsets, queues, writef, write
** TODO Test on Mac, Windows (32 bit) and R/Pi
* Missing features
** Compiler
*** TODO Replace use of atomic_list_concat/2 with hand-written, simpler operations
*** Allow selective tracing
    - declaration "trace(PI)", where PI may be atom, NAME/ARITY, or
      list of those.
** Library/Runtime
*** TODO clause-DB
    - file:cdb.pl
*** Make it possible to embed compiled code
    - "suspend(IN, OUT)" saves state and suspends execution.
    - define alternative entry-point via macro and return procedure
      ptr to invoke prolog (similar to BONES).
    - also allow access to global_variables, and (prefixed) access
      function.
*** Runtime-information about defined clauses
    - as minimum: mapping of name/arity -> entry-point.
    - for complete support of clause/2 we would actually need the full
      source.
    - at least compiler could offer "call_predicate".
* Diagnostics
** Detect singleton variables
** Detect redefinitions of primitives
** Detect undefined predicate calls
** Detect non-contiguous predicates
* TODO Once we have a suitable test, compare performance with other implementations
  - maybe file:queens.pl
  - SWI, GNU-Prolog, BinProlog
* Issues
** Compiler
*** TODO Unbound var in arithmetic expr doesn't show variable name
   - extend var-rep to hold name, in addition to index.
*** TODO check fixnum range when emitting literals 
** Runtime
*** TODO Reconsider default data-area sizes
*** TODO trail-GC
    - and adjust CP-stack entries accordingly.
    - tricky.
*** TODO Is cycle-checking in =deref= really necessary?
** Libraries
*** TODO op/3 should throw ISO-compliant exceptions
